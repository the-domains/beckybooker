**Becky Booker **studied piano performance at Wilfrid Laurier University, graduating in 2000\. It was at Laurier that she caught the vocal accompaniment bug, and since then she has become an integral part of the Kitchener Waterloo music scene as a collaborative pianist. These days Becky can be found playing regularly for the Grand Philharmonic Children's and Youth Choirs, coaching voice students at Conrad Grebel College, and directing music at Grace Mennonite Brethren Church. Over the years, Becky has enjoyed playing for countless voice students, choirs, recordings, auditions, musical theatre productions, dance classes, and religious services.
